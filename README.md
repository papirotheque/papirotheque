I'm **Papiro** / **AEON**, a multidisciplinary designer who looks for insights across different fields.

I believe great design happens at the intersection of disciplines.

My process is a continuous loop of exploration: drawing from art, UX, programming and beyond to solve complex problems, or just for experimental purposes.

I view design/art/technology as methods to help others navigate complex information from the real world. 

That's why I decided to become a designer, and now, a developer.
